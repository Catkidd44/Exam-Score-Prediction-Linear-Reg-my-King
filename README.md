# Exam-Score-Prediction-Linear-Reg-my-King
This project uses a Kaggle dataset to identify a model that minimizes MSE and MAE while maintaining a high R². After testing models of varying complexity, including ensembles, linear regression performed best—showing that sometimes simpler models are optimal and the data should guide model choice.

I tried to find a model that could fit the data the best. I attempted more complex methods but came to the conclusion that sometimes the simple ones do the trick.
Linear Regression was the best performing one and it was not close. Hope you enjoy the project.

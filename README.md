# Exam-Score-Prediction-Linear-Reg-my-King
This project uses a Kaggle dataset to identify a model that minimizes MSE and MAE while maintaining a high R². After testing models of varying complexity, including ensembles, linear regression performed best—showing that sometimes simpler models are optimal and the data should guide model choice..
